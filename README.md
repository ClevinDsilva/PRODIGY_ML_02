##Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective

Use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on:
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- File Used: `Mall_Customers.csv`

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

- Understanding clustering and unsupervised learning
- Applying K-Means and choosing optimal clusters using the Elbow method
- Visualizing customer segments to identify patterns in purchase behavior

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

- Elbow Method plot to choose optimal clusters (e.g., k=5)
- Cluster visualization based on Annual Income and Spending Score

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle  
3. Run the notebook `Task2_CustomerSegmentation.ipynb`
